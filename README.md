Business Process Reengineering 
This project documents the consultancy work carried out by Choose Consulting for the Neapolitan delicatessen “’A Muzzarella Mia Parla”, aimed at optimizing business processes through Business Process Reengineering (BPR).

The initial analysis identified several critical issues, including manual inventory management, the absence of an online sales system, and inefficient business processes. The proposed solution leverages the Odoo ERP system to:

- Automate inventory management, enabling real-time stock monitoring and optimized restocking processes.

- Implement an online sales system, including a website and e-commerce platform to expand market reach.

- Enhance order processing, reducing errors and improving efficiency through digital tools.

- Improve overall business performance, with key performance indicators (KPIs) tracking efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The project also includes a feasibility study comparing Odoo Community and Enterprise editions, as well as a structured implementation plan with risk analysis and project management strategies.
